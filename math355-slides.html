<h1>Getting started with Git</h1>
<p>Today we will discuss the delivery method of all course materials, assignments, and projects. This method will rely on learning <code>git</code>.</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)">Wikipedia</a>, “Git is a version control system that is used for software development and other version control tasks. As a distributed revision control system it is aimed at speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.”</li>
<li>Basically, it is a more sophisticated Dropbox and allows you to keep your code up to date across multiple platforms.</li>
<li>A complete walk through of Git can be found online at <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2"><code>https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2</code></a>.</li>
<li>Today we will only learn the basics.</li>
</ul>
</div><div id="sign-up-with-github" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Sign up with GitHub</h1>
<p>If you don’t already have an account, you will need a GitHub account. You can do so here: <a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</a>.</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>I’ll wait here while you do this. <img src="./src/img/cat-waiting.gif" /></li>
<li>Once you are finished, come up and enter your username on my computer, this send out an email inviting you to join the class.</li>
</ul>
</div><div id="welcome-to-the-class" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Welcome to the class!</h1>
<ul>
<li>Once you have accepted your invite, you now have access to the coures materials.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/math-355"><code>https://github.com/math-355</code></a></li>
<li>The page should look something like this. Feel free to poke around.</li>

<h1>Mandatory Syllabus time.</h1>
<p>You can find the syllabus as well as resources on the landing page <a href="https://github.com/math-355"><code>https://github.com/math-355</code></a></p>
</div><div id="cloning-forking-a-repo" class="slide section level2">
<h1>Cloning Forking a Repo</h1>
<p>First, what is a repo and why would you want to do these things to it? <strong>Repo</strong> is short for repository which is basically a directory of files and folders. Think of your GitHub account as a large folder containing other folders (repos). Each repo is a different project, or in this case, a weekly objective. If you just created a GitHub account, then you don’t have any repos yet. We are going to change that.</p>
<p>This is where forking comes in. You need to copy the <code>Lab01-Intro-to-GitHub-Spring-2018</code> repo into your account. This way you can edit/add files. A <strong>Fork</strong> of a repo is like a fork in a road. There is a main road (the original <code>Lab01-Intro-to-GitHub-Spring-2018</code> repo) and a fork off the road (your repo). At any time you are editing the forked repo (or traveling the forked road), you can go back to the original.</p>
<p>Forking the a repo is super easy. All you need to do is click the fork button at the top of this page (<a href="https://github.com/csc-171/Lab01-Intro-to-GitHub-Spring-2018">https://github.com/csc-171/Lab01-Intro-to-GitHub-Spring-2018</a>) and select the account to fork to. <strong>Do this now, then scroll down to this spot on the new page.</strong></p>
<p>Bam! You have forked a repo! Congratulations. If all went well, you should see something like this at the top of the page:</p>

<p>The only difference is that your username should be displayed and not <code>b-stone</code>. I.e. you should see something like this, <code>YOURUSERNAME/Lab01-Intro-to-GitHub-Spring-2018</code>.</p>
<p><strong>From now on, this is the first thing you should do when you start a lab in this class.</strong></p>
