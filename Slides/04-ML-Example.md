# Example of Machine Learning Project

## The problem

- what is the task
- what type of task is this? Supervised? Unsupervised? etc?
- How are you going to measure sucess?

## Creating a training and test set

- 80/20 split
- make sure not to pick the wrong 80/20 split
- don't look at test set (ever)

## Understanding the data

- looking at samples
- corolation
- charts and stuff

## Cleaning the data

- making labels
- Filling in missing data
- adding more data
- deleting outliers and unwanted info
- making numbers count

## Forming a pipeline

## Try out different models

## Address issues 

- this is where math can help
- over fitting
- under fitting
- playing with parameters

## Now test and deploy!
